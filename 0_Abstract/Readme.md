# Abstract
Wiper Control System is present in every automotive system. Windshield wipers keep the windshield of a vehicle clear from rain water, snow, dust and road spray. The first windshield wipers were operated manually by moving a lever inside the car. Later wiper designs were powered by the engine's manifold vacuum. Virtually all wipers today employ an electric motor coupled with a linkage mechanism and are actuated by a knob beside the steering wheel. The wiper blade speed can be adjusted by the driver.It is used to clear the windshield from water during rainy season. We are imitating a wiper system using LEDs present in the STM32F4-Discovery. The positions and speed of the wiper is also controlled using the Cube IDE.
